Description: A tool for permutation-like testing of variable importance
    measures (VIMP) obtained from random forest (RF).  It allows the user
    to make an informed choice of informative covariates based on the raw,
    FWER and FDR corrected p-values obtained from the tests. The package
    also provides a function that allows the results obtained to be
    conveniently visualised as box plots.
