    person(given = "Tim", family = "Mueller", email = "mueller@staburo.de", role = "aut"),

Description: A statistical tool for reducing the number of covariates in an
  analysis by evaluating Variable Importance Measures (VIMPs) derived from the    
  Random Forest algorithm. It performs a statistical tests on the VIMPs and    
  outputs a decision as to whether the covariate is significant along with the      
  raw, FWER and FDR corrected p-values.
