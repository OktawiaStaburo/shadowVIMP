Version: 1.0.1
Authors@R: c(
    person("Tim", "Mueller", , "mueller@staburo.de", role = "aut"),

Description: A statistical method for reducing the number of covariates in
    an analysis by evaluating Variable Importance Measures (VIMPs) derived
    from the Random Forest algorithm. It performs statistical tests on the
    VIMPs and outputs whether the covariate is significant along with the
    p-values.
