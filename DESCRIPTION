Description: A statistical tool for reducing the number of covariates in an 
  analysis by evaluating Variable Importance Measures (VIMPs) derived from
  the Random Forest algorithm. It performs statistical tests on the VIMPs
  and outputs whether the covariate is significant along with the p-values.
