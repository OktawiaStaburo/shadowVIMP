## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* I modified the code such that information messages printed in the console can
be easily suppressed.

* Although it was requested to add references in the DESCRIPTION file describing
the methods implemented in the package, I have not done so yet. The paper 
introducing the methodology is not yet published, the CRAN package is a 
prerequisite for promoting it in the publication. The paper has already been 
presented at two events (DAGStat 2025 and Biometric Colloquium  of the Medical
University of Vienna, see links below). We intend to add the reference to the 
DESCRIPTION as soon as the paper is published. Therefore, I kindly request that 
this requirement be deferred until then.
